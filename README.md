# suffix-tree

A Python implementation of Suffix Trees using an O(nÂ²) naive approach. Also provides a method to solve the longest repeated substring problem. Outputs the tuple `(substring, start, no. repetitions)`.

The script `sarscov.py` provides an example of usage. To run the script, use:
```bash
python3 sarscov.py genome_file
```
